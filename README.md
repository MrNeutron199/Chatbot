# Chatbot
This website uses Google's Palm API to create a chatbot. It is filled with data and can be useful at times.
Although, I had to make a a lot of if-else statements for very basic questions such as "name" or "developer" as the API does not seem to reply to those questions. It works fine for most cases though.
